# Writers-Nook

This is a personal project for myself to make a minimal site that allows you to write and create stories.

I intend to start with building a minimal site that will be able to use a local storage cache to save works to begin with and then move to a remote storage option in the future intergrating an SQL database.

I want to use reusable components with [CSS container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) to allow for them to be used across different devices and scale accordingly.
